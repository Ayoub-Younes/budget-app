# Budget App

## Project Overview

The Budget App is a Python-based application that allows users to manage multiple budget categories, track their spending, and visualize their expenses in a simple chart. Users can create categories, deposit funds, withdraw money, and transfer amounts between categories. Additionally, the app generates a spending chart that visually represents the percentage of total expenses allocated to each category.

This project demonstrates essential finance management concepts, showcasing how budget allocation can be organized and displayed through Python's string manipulation, arithmetic operations, and object-oriented programming (OOP).

## Technologies Used

Python: The core programming language for implementing the budget app logic.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Used to create the Category class for organizing and managing budgets.
String Manipulation: Employed for formatting the output of ledger transactions and for displaying the spending chart.
Arithmetic Operations: To handle budget calculations such as deposits, withdrawals, and the percentage of spending.
